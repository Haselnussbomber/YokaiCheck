## [1.1.0] (2024-04-26)

- **Added:** A DTR service has been added to show the medal count of the medal you're currently farming in the server info bar. This can be disabled in the Dalamud Settings. It will also automatically hide when you switch zones.
- **Fixed:** Minion/weapon mapping was incorrect. Very sorry about that! (I learned it the hard way by farming 10 medals of a weapon I already had...)
