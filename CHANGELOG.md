# Changelog

## [1.2.0] (2024-04-27)

- **Added:** The server info bar entry can not be clicked to open the plugin window.
- **Added:** The server info bar entry now shows the locations in the tooltip in which you can farm the medals.
- **Added:** In the table, the medal count of each weapon now also has a tooltip that shows the locations in which you can farm them. A location displayed in a green color is your current location.
- **Added:** In the table, the minion name can now be clicked to summon it and will be shown in a green color when it is currently summoned.
- **Changed:** The server info bar entry is now based on the currently summoned minion (previously it was based on inventory changes - the medals that were added) and will persist between zones until the minion is sent away.

## [1.1.0] (2024-04-26)

- **Added:** A DTR service has been added to show the medal count of the medal you're currently farming in the server info bar. This can be disabled in the Dalamud Settings. It will also automatically hide when you switch zones.
- **Fixed:** Minion/weapon mapping was incorrect. Very sorry about that! (I learned it the hard way by farming 10 medals of a weapon I already had...)
